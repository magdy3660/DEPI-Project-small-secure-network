# Network Security Effectiveness Report

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates the effectiveness of the security measures implemented in our network, which includes an EdgeRouter, rootRouter, two switches (Switch0 and Switch1), and a firewall (FW2) protecting the data center. The implemented security controls provide a solid foundation for network protection, but there are areas for potential improvement.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. EdgeRouter Security

**Strengths:**

- Network Address Translation (NAT) effectively hides internal IP addresses
- Basic Access Control List (ACL) filters incoming traffic
- SSH enabled for secure remote management

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Consider implementing more granular ACLs
- Explore options for Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) functionality

**Effectiveness: 7/10**

### 2. Internal Routing and VLAN Segmentation

**Strengths:**

- VLANs (10, 20, 30) properly segmented for different departments
- Inter-VLAN routing controlled by ACLs on rootRouter

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Implement stricter inter-VLAN communication policies
- Consider deploying a next-generation firewall for advanced threat protection between VLANs

**Effectiveness: 8/10**

### 3. Switch Security (Switch0 and Switch1)

**Strengths:**

- Port security limits the number of MAC addresses per port
- VLANs properly configured
- SSH enabled for secure management

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Implement DHCP snooping to prevent rogue DHCP servers
- Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) to prevent ARP spoofing attacks
- Configure IP Source Guard to prevent IP spoofing

**Effectiveness: 6/10**

### 4. Data Center Protection (FW2)

**Strengths:**

- Dedicated firewall (FW2) protecting the data center
- ACLs controlling access to critical services (ports 993, 995, 110, 143, 21)

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Consider deploying an application-layer firewall for enhanced protection
- Explore options for implementing Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

**Effectiveness: 7/10**
### 5. Overall Network Security

**Strengths:**

- Basic security measures implemented across all devices
- Clear network segmentation with VLANs
- Secure management access (SSH) configured on all devices

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Implement a centralized logging and monitoring solution
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
- Implement a patch management strategy for all network devices

**Overall Effectiveness: 7/10**

## Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized logging and real-time threat detection.
2. **Advanced Threat Protection:** Consider deploying next-generation firewalls or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) at critical network junctions.
3. **Switch Hardening:** Implement additional security features on switches, including DHCP snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and IP Source Guard.
4. **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses.
5. **Security Awareness Training:** Develop and implement a security awareness program for all users to complement technical controls.
6. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to ensure quick and effective responses to security incidents.

## Conclusion

The current network security configuration provides a solid foundation but has room for improvement. By implementing the recommended enhancements, the overall security posture of the network can be significantly strengthened. Regular reviews and updates to the security configuration will be crucial to maintain an effective defense against evolving cyber threats.
